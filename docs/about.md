# About Me
![portfolio image](img/about-photo.png)

## Who is "me"?
I'm Marcelo, a Senior at MIT studying Course 6-3 (Computer Science). I'm from the US, but I traveled a lot when I was younger. I'm also a photographer, mostly shooting street and landscape photography.

## What's this page?
This is a page for my 6.1040 (Software Design) class. The main goal is to learn how to design software with people in mind.

## What's the plan with this class?
I hope to get more experience in design and to learn some new technologies. I already have some experience (Check it out [here](https://www.mjmaza.dev/)), but I want to improve on it while adding some other features and projects.
