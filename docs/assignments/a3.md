# Converging on ArtClick

## Pitch
<!-- Design idea: focus on guaranteeing originality and stopping reposters part of the app -->
Welcome to ArtClick, the app made for the artist in you. ArtClick is the platform designed to make sure that artists get the recognition they deserve, by allowing them to make sure that their projects stay with them on any platform. Whenever you post on ArtClick, we make sure that your content stays yours by periodically checking ArtClick and other platforms for potential reposts. If we find one, we will let you know so you can keep your work truly yours.

## Functional Design
### Core Concepts
<details name="concepts">
<summary><b>Posting</b></summary>
Adds items to ArtClick

- Operational Principle: after adding all the content, looking up the post will return the same content

States: 
- allPosts: set Post
- post: allPosts -> one Post
- images: set Image
- postImages: images -> set Images
- status: Post -> one LikedStatus

Actions:
- create: Create a post
- delete: Delete a post
- like: Like a post
- dislike: Dislike a post
</details>
<details name="concepts">
<summary><b>Checking</b></summary>
Verifies no content is duplicated on ArtClick or other platforms
    
- Operational Principle: after adding content, they can see if other copies of the content exists

States:
- images: set User -> set Images

Actions:
- check: Check for a copy of the item, then return the locations of the copies
</details>

<details name="concepts">
<summary><b>Authenticating</b></summary>
 Authenticates so users see the corresponding content

 - Operational Principle: after registering with a username and password, they can authenticate using said username and password

States: 
- users: set User
- username, password: users -> one JSON with username and password

Actions:
- register: Register username and password
- update: Change username or password
- delete: Remove user
</details>

<details name="concepts">
<summary><b>Whitelisting</b></summary>
 Allows repost from cetain accounts

 - Operational Principle: after getting a list of items and locations, removes the items that have an allowed location

States: 
- whitelist: set Users -> set Locations

Actions:
- remove: Remove an entry
</details>

<details name="concepts">
<summary><b>Tracking</b></summary>
 Tracks locations that repost, and mark the ones that appear multiple times in a given timespan

 - Operational Principle: after getting a list of locations, count how many times each appears.

States: 
- locations: set Location
- location: locations -> one Location
- locationCounter: Location -> Number

Actions:
- update: Add 1 to location counter
- remove: Set location counter to 0
</details>

### App-level Actions
<details name="app-level">
<summary><b>Filtering Checked Images</b></summary>

 Include **Checking**, **Whitelisting**, and **Tracking**

``` js
sync filter(image, user) {
    list = Checking.check(image);
    list = Whitelisting.remove(list);
    Tracking.add(list);
}
```
</details>

## Design Iteration
When designing the **Checking** concepts. I realized that we needed a way to whitelist official reposts and accounts, since artists usually have more than one social media account or have accounts that they don't want to be taken down. As such, **Whitelisting** would remove the accounts from the repost look-up.

Another conceptual change was **Tracking**. Sometime reposters compile art from multiple artists, so tracking if anyone shows up multiple times in a given timespan would allow for artists to decide if it is better to report the account or just the individual posts.

## Design Tradeoffs
One of the main tradeoffs is how frequently **Checking** will actually apply to each user. As the platform grows, the period between checks will have to become larger unless either a more efficient search is found or there is horizontal growth for ArtClick.
