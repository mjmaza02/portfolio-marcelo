# ArtClick Frontend
[See it Here!](https://a4-front.vercel.app/)

[Repository](https://github.com/mjmaza02/a4-front)

Now with ArtClick's backend implemented, we can now work on the frontend. First, we will analyze the wireframes and evaluate their user experience and heuristics. Then, we will iterate over these and make changes to both the frontend and backend respectively.

## Heuristic Analysis

### Usability
#### Discoverability
 - Change all the icons to a more common iconography (ex: the like into üëç)
 - Clarify how the Reposts works
 - Add tagging to relate posts
#### Safety
 - Add safety features to whitespace and repost control, such as a confirmation or cancel button
 - Can cancel and edit posts

### Physical Heuristics
#### Perceptual Fusion
 - It will need some sort of loading animation when retreaving posts
#### Fitts' Law
 - Most elements have quick access
 - Reposts should be moved to the header instead of the user menu

### Linguistic Heuristics
#### User's Language
 - Uses common language, such as posts
 - Add tooltips or tutorial for some aspects, such as reposts and whitelist
#### Consistency
 - Is self consistent
 - Add a clear indicator for active/selected components
