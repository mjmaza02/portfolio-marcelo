## User Test Tasks

| Task              | Instruction                                                                                 | Rationale                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Making forum post | Post a question asking for advice on the best leg exercisesn                                | We want to see whether or not it is intuitive for the user to go to the threads page if they want to ask a question to the general public. If not, we need to change the phrasing of the threads page or potentially add messages indicating to the user that they can make public forum posts to ask questions or offer insight about anything fitness related. |
| Workout post      | Post your workout with a picture                                                            | This will allow us to see whether the page to post a workout is self-explanatory or if we need to add specific instructions to the user about how the app works in general. It also tests whether or not it is obvious to the users that the main page contains the post features, as it is not part of the navigation bar.                                      |
| Forum response    | Answer a question asked by “claire” and upvote her post                                     | This will test if the search feature is prominent enough for users to think of using it to search for a specific thread rather than scrolling through the list of threads. It will also allow us to see if the thumbs up emoji is indicative of an upvote for the user.                                                                                          |
| Messaging         | Send a workout to “claire”                                                                  | We want to test if the user will think of going to the messaging page to send a workout and whether or not the button to do so is easy to find.                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Fitness tracker   | Set your fitness goal to gaining strength and create a task that will help you achieve that | We want to test if it is obvious for users to set and modify fitness goals on the “tracking” page and if it is easy to search through the different features on the page since there is a lot of text.                                                                                                                                                           |

## Design Revisions

- Messages
  - We decided to include a text messenger rather than an inbox so users can easily converse about topics and send multiple tasks within the same conversation
- Sending Tasks
  - We decided to only allow users to send tasks through the messenger page through the ‘add task’ button so that tasks are personalized for each user, which is important for beginners.
- Posting concept
  - Originally, we were planning on having forum posts and workout posts on the same page. We chose to separate them since we want users to easily search for forum posts and ask questions on a page separate from the workout posts with pictures.
- Verifying posts
  - We made it so that users cannot verify their own posts.
- Points
  - Posts and threads that other users find relevant should promote their author. Points are awarded for verified posts and threads (another user upvotes), and for popular posts/threads. Users are also rewarded for verifying.
- Leaderboard
  - We decided to display the leaderboard on all pages to make it a more prominent feature.
- Threads
  - Since threads are for discussion between people, we decided to make them only accept text input.
  - Threads that are relevant will get more upvotes, which means that we should reward those accounts by giving them points.
